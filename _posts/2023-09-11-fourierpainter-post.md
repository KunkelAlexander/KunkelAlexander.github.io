<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n this blog's first post, we will visualise a complex Fourier transform as sum of plane waves. </p>


## Intro
The visualisation is recreated from a series of excellent explanatory videos on the Fourier transform by the Youtube channel <em>3Blue1Brown</em>. As an example, we are going to draw an elephant.<br>
Before diving in, below is a gif showing an animation of our result:

## Discrete Fourier transform

The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and its inverse (IDFT) are defined as\
$$ \hat{f}(\omega) = \sum_{t=0}^{N-1} f(t) \cdot e^{-i 2 \pi t n/N}, \qquad f(t) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \hat{f}(k) \cdot e^{+i 2 \pi k t/N}$$\
for a function $$f$$ taking real or complex values and $$N > 0$$. 
Discrete Fourier transforms are ubiquitous in image and signal processing. They allow the decomposition of a time-dependent signal into a sum of plane waves with constant frequencies: Each frequency $$k$$ corresponds to a vector of constant length $$\frac{1}{N} \hat{f}(k)$$. At a given time, it points in the direction of the plane wave $$e^{+i 2 \pi k t/N}$$, that is, the point $$(\cos(2 \pi k t/N), \sin(2 \pi k t/N))$$ in the complex plane. The sum of plane waves is equal to adding the vectors with the sum of vectors pointing to the complex number $$f(t)$$. Time evolution implies that each vector rotates at constant speed tracing a circle.

To start, we take the discrete Fourier transform of a periodic ($$f(t) = f(t + \delta t)$$), time-dependent input function. Our input function $$f(t)$$ is [von Neumann's 4-parameter elephant][vonneumann-elephant-wiki].

def elephant(t):
    y =  50*np.sin(t)+18*np.sin(2*t)-12*np.cos(3*t)+14*np.cos(5*t)
    x = -60*np.cos(t)+30*np.sin(t)  - 8*np.sin(2*t)+10*np.sin(3*t)
    return x/100 + 1j*y/100

# number of points at which to sample elephant
N      = 128
times  = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, N+1)
# compute time-series data for elephant
f      = elephant(times)
# compute Fourier transform excluding f[-1] == f[0]
fHat   = np.fft.fft(f[:-1])
{%- endhighlight -%}

In the next step, we compute the IDFT at a given time by first calculating an array containing the plane waves with the magnitudes calculated by the DFT and then sort them from low to high frequencies.

{%- highlight python -%}
# time at which to evaluate IDFT
t      = 64 
# plane waves with coefficient determined by FFT of input data 
waves  = fHat*np.exp(1j*2*np.pi*t*np.arange(N)/N)/len(fHat)
# returns frequencies corresponding to entries of fHat
# for N even: 0, 1, 2, ..., N/2, -N/2 - 1, ..., -1
freqs  = np.fft.fftfreq(N)
# sort waves by magnitude of frequencies from slow to fast 
waves  = waves[np.argsort(np.abs(freqs))]
{%- endhighlight -%}

Finally, we plot the elephant as well as the vectors the plane waves describe and the circles they trace:

# create figure
fig, ax = plt.subplots(dpi=600)
plt.axis("off") 
plt.style.use('dark_background')

linewidths     = np.logspace(-5, 5, 20, base=2)
transparencies = np.linspace(+1, 0, 20)
for lw, alpha in zip(linewidths, transparencies):
    plt.plot(np.real(f[:t+1]), np.imag(f[:t+1]), \
             lw=lw, alpha=alpha, c='#08F7FE')
    
# first vector starts at origin
x      = 0
y      = 0
# do not show vectors shorter than cutoff
cutoff = 1e-2

# sum over plane waves
for i in range(N):
    # determine direction of vectors 
    dx = np.real(waves[i])
    dy = np.imag(waves[i])

    # do not show very short vectors
    if np.abs(waves[i]) > cutoff:
        plt.arrow(x = x, y = y, dx = dx, dy = dy, lw = 0.1,\
                  head_width=0.01, head_length=0.02,\
                  length_includes_head=True)
        ax.add_patch(plt.Circle((x,y), np.abs(waves[i]), \
                     fill = False, lw=0.5))

    # sum up plane waves
    x += dx
    y += dy

plt.savefig("elephant.png")
{%- endhighlight -%}

The final result looks as follows:

If you like you can play around with the code and use different input data. Have fun!
